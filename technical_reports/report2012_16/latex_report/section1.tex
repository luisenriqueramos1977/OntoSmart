\section{Report Scope}\label{scope}
%%\begin{spacing}{1.5}
Within this report we pretend to present the results of implementing Onto\textit{Smart}\footnote{https://github.com/luisenriqueramos1977/OntoSmart}, a methodology for the development of network of heterogeneous (logically speaking) ontologies, with the aim of overcoming limitations of ontology languages like \gls{owl}.
